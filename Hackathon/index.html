        <strong> Music</strong> the art of arranging sounds in time through the
        elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.It is one of the
        universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions
        of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and
        harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and
        articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities
        of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a
        musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize,
        de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a
        vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to
        rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such
        as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine
        singing and instruments.

        <strong> The </strong>creation, performance, significance, and even the
        definition of music vary according to culture and social context.
        Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been
        criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge
        string quartet in 1825,early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and
        hardcore punk in the 1980s.There are many types of music, including
        popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious
        ceremonies, and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly
        organized compositions—such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s
        and 1800s—through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as
        jazz, and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the
        20th and 21st centuries.

        <strong> Music </strong>is composed and performed for many purposes,
        ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as
        an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only
        available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and
        Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite
        pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano.
        With the advent of the phonograph, records of popular songs, rather than
        sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their
        favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and
        digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists
        of their favourite songs and take them with them on a portable cassette
        player or MP3 player. Some music lovers create mix tapes of their
        favourite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of
        friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment
        consisting solely of what is most ardently loved".
